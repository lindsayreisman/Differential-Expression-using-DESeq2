# Differential-Expression-using-DESeq2

Differential expression analysis pipeline was ran on a RNA-seq dataset comparing treatment and control breast cancer cells with a goal to understand what genes play a role in suppressing NRDE2. mRNA profiles of 3 control cell lines and 3 NRDE2-treated (NRDE2 silenced with RNAi) cells ran in triplicate. The libraries are single-end (SE) sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform.
